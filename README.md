The project is currently under heavy development while adding new material for the winter term 2019/20.

The [output branch](https://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-exercises/tree/outputs) contains executed notebooks with results and plots, whereas the master branch
contains no outputs at all for convenient diff while developing.
